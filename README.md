## üöÄ Deployment Guide

### 1. S3 Setup
- Created a public S3 bucket named `iam-visualizer-project`.
- Enabled static website hosting.
- Uploaded files manually first for testing.

### 2. CloudFront Setup
- Created a CloudFront distribution pointing to the S3 bucket.
- Enabled index/root object handling.
- Used the CloudFront URL for public access.

### 3. GitHub Actions CI/CD
- Initialized a GitHub repo and pushed the website code.
- Created a workflow file (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) to deploy on push to `master`.
- Stored `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` in GitHub secrets.
- Used the `jakejarvis/s3-sync-action` GitHub Action to sync files to S3.

## üß† Architecture Overview

The architecture showcases a CI/CD pipeline for deploying a static website to Amazon S3 using GitHub Actions. The developer pushes code to GitHub, which triggers an automated deployment workflow. The workflow uses IAM credentials stored securely as GitHub Secrets to sync files to an S3 bucket configured for static website hosting in the `us-east-1` region. CloudFront, acting as a CDN, fetches content from the S3 bucket and serves it to users via a globally distributed HTTPS endpoint. This setup ensures fast delivery, secure access, and automatic deployment on every code change.

The diagram was created using [Cloudcraft](https://www.cloudcraft.co/), a visual tool designed specifically for AWS architecture planning.
